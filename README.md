- 👋 Hi, I’m @maroline-johnson
- 👀 I’m interested in the software development lifecycle. How does code move from a brain to a screen? 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code! I've never done it before, and I'm using Codecademy to teach me. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tips and tricks. Do you have any advice for a beginner? 
- 📫 Feel free to email me at maroline.johnson@gmail.com
