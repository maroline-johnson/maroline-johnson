- 👋 Hi, I’m @maroline-johnson, and I live in Chicago, IL. 
- 👀 I’m interested in the software development lifecycle. How does code move from a brain to a browser? 
- 🌱 I’m always learning more about how to code! I only started in 2023, and I use Codecademy and Simplilearn for ongoing education. 
- 💞️ I’m passionate about DevOps because optimizing processes can drastically improve the developer experience! What do you wish could be better about yours? 
- 📫 Feel free to email me at maroline.johnson@gmail.com
